[Webinar â€“ Creating a Hardware Abstraction Layer in LabVIEW](http://blog.jki.net/labview/webinar-creating-a-hardware-abstraction-layer-in-labview/)

## How To: 

1. Apply the VI Package Configuration using VI Package Manager (vipm.jki.net) for LabVIEW 2015
2. Open HAL Webinar.lvproj in LabVIEW 2013+ IDE
3. From the project environment, Run "Microscope.TestLauncher.vi"
4. Click on wells to see the XYStage move to that location and capture a simulated image.

*To use Camera.IMAQdx class, you will require a valid Vision RunTime License or Vision Development License from National Instruments (ni.com)

## Settings files 
- You can edit "simulated.ini" file provided to change the relative path to images folder and use your own images
- You can edit "hal.ini" file provided to use a more specific camera (IMAQdx code provided).

To add your own camera or XYStage classes derived from these base classes, open "Microscope.lvclass:enumerateStaticDependencies.vi" and modify the configuration-driven dependency injection and add your specific class in the appropriate case structure.

If you have any questions, please contact JKI at jki.net or create an issue on this thread.
We hope you enjoy trying the code and creating awesome Hardware Abstraction Layers for your projects!
